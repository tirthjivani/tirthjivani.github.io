                        Some careers are entirely focused on helping people. Think about teachers, police, nurses, doctors, firefighters, social workers, and the like. Others are not directly aimed at helping people but indirectly do so nonetheless. User experience design falls into this category. Learning and practicing good user experience requires a degree of empathy with your users and understanding exactly how you can solve their problems.
                        Good UX design can have a significant positive impact on the world. By focusing their talents, UX designers can make meaningful changes and drive towards social good.

                        I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the
                        target user and their needs. I discovered that many target users treat online shopping as a fun
                        and relaxing activity when they need a break from school or work. However, many shopping
                        websites are overwhelming and confusing to navigate, which frustrated many target users. This

                        The target users of the MooddL website will be any kind of teachers or instructors, students,
                        and their parents. Most of them usually worked on the assignments and view these over laptop
                        browsers, but in some cases, they prefer to use mobile screens. That's why I created a
                        responsive web app design for this.
                        The key differentiator of this user group is the purpose of using MooddL. Instructors or
                        teachers want to give the work or material and students or parents want to get the instructions
                        or get the status of any assignment or get the scores of the assignment. This brings us to
                        assuming 2 main personas that are of a student and a teacher.

                        My goal here was to make strategic information architecture decisions that would improve overall
                        website navigation. The structure I chose was designed to make things simple and easy.​​​​​

                        I always wondered how online e-commerce stores worked and the more interesting fact to hear is
                        blind people tend to purchase more goods online than a normal human. That's why as a part of the
                        design for social good I selected the topic to design a viable solution for the problem. Thus I
                        created Afterglow.<br />
                        The first thing which was the key takeaway from this project was that learning and practicing a
                        good user experience requires a degree of empathy with your users and a good UX design can have
                        a significant positive impact on the world.<br />
                        I have used a user-centered approach for designing the application. I also understood that not
                        every user has the same perspective on a problem. I learned how small elements are important and
                        they contribute to making a big difference. I understood the need of having heterogeneous user
                        groups, making a more effective product experience. <br />
                        On top of it, empathizing with the minority group and creating an impactful design is way more
                        fruitful for even other users.<br />
                        Hope to learn more amazing things 😇.<br />
