                        Some careers are entirely focused on helping people. Think about teachers, police, nurses, doctors, firefighters, social workers, and the like. Others are not directly aimed at helping people but indirectly do so nonetheless. User experience design falls into this category. Learning and practicing good user experience requires a degree of empathy with your users and understanding exactly how you can solve their problems.
                        Good UX design can have a significant positive impact on the world. By focusing their talents, UX designers can make meaningful changes and drive towards social good.
                        <br />
                        This is a try to create an e-commerce application with multiple accessibility features that eases the buying process for blind people.

                    Shopping is a very vast topic and enjoyable to every person. Evidently, some items need minutiae to view like cars, sofa color and design, carpet color, and many others, which is a challenging task for a blind person to purchase. That's why I took the challenge and thoughtfully researched different types of blindness and how an application can change it. There are some key points to focus on before taking the research into consideration. <br/>
                    This application is for all the users but it is made extra accessible with some features such that a blind user can also operate easily. <br />

                    After collecting the analysis data from the initial study, creating the problem statement, and finalizing the pain points of the users in the prior steps, I moved to the ideation phase where I user the infamous Crazy 8's ideation techniques. I created 3 to 4 crazy 8's user flow and out of them I selected one. Then I created a user journey map of what a basic start to finish journey looks like while ordering an item. It helps in understanding ways users can interact with the product, as well as allowing us to see navigation through user goals. Then wireframed each screen on paper. Followed by a digital wireframe I joined the basic screens to make a meaningful flow of the user path. <br />

                    I always wondered how online e-commerce stores worked and the more interesting fact to hear is blind people tend to purchase more goods online than a normal human. That's why as a part of the design for social good I selected the topic to design a viable solution for the problem. Thus I created Afterglow.<br />
                    The first thing which was the key takeaway from this project was that learning and practicing a good user experience requires a degree of empathy with your users and a good UX design can have a significant positive impact on the world.<br />
                    I have used a user-centered approach for designing the application. I also understood that not every user has the same perspective on a problem. I learned how small elements are important and they contribute to making a big difference. I understood the need of having heterogeneous user groups, making a more effective product experience. <br />
                    On top of it, empathizing with the minority group and creating an impactful design is way more fruitful for even other users.<br />
                    Hope to learn more amazing things 😇.<br />
